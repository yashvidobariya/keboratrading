          <h4>What it does</h4>
          <p>
            A car rental company provides a convenient service for renting
            automobiles for a short period, typically from a few hours to
            several weeks. This allows individuals and businesses to have
            temporary access to a vehicle without the costs and responsibilities
            of ownership. Car rental companies operate a fleet of vehicles,
            offering a range of models from compact cars to SUVs and vans, and
            often have locations at airports and in city centers for easy
            access.
          </p>
          <h4>Target Audience</h4>
          <p>

            <li>
              Local Residents: People who need a temporary vehicle for various
              reasons, such as when their own car is being repaired, when they
              need a larger vehicle for a special occasion (like a family trip
              or moving furniture), or for those who don't own a car and need
              one for a weekend getaway.
